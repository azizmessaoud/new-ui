    lesson: "The avatar fallback was necessary because browser environments did not always handle the preferred rendering path consistently.",

    lesson: "Scanned tables and inconsistent layouts were the main sources of OCR errors, so I kept confidence and source-page information for later review.",
    outcome: "The prototype works end to end on synthetic documents. It still needs testing with real documents before its OCR accuracy and production reliability can be judged.",
